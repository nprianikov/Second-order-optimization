# Second-order optimization for Image Classification

This repository contains the code used in my BSc thesis, "Second-order optimization for Image Classification". The purpose of this project was to explore the convergence behaviour and applicability of second-order optimization methods for image classification tasks, and to compare 
their performance with first-order stochastic gradient.
